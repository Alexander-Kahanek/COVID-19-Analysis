# Covid-19-Analysis

Welcome to my Covid-19 Analysis and prediction model!

My Covid-19 Analysis includes an in-depth look at Italys' Confirmed Deaths. It also includes a complete walkthrough of how I build my algorithm, in order to predict the future Death Counts! 
* It will also include an Analysis of my model
*******

* The Covid-19-Analysis.rmd is the file that contains my Analysis and walkthrough behind building my predictive model!

* The Covid-19-Script.R is the script that you can use to generate any results off of my model! It has settings you can adjust at the top, and explains how to run it inside the script!

* The graphs folder will include all graphs that I have made for the Analysis, as well as for my predictive model!     

******* 
PLANS

* I plan on designing a graph that will pair my predictive models up with the actual data, as it gets released!

* When everything is said and done, I will do a short follow up Analysis on how well my predictive algorithm stood up to time!
