# Covid-19-Analysis
IN PROGRESS

Welcome to my Covid-19 Analysis and prediction model!

My Covid-19 Analysis includes an in-depth look at Italys' Confirmed Deaths. It also includes a complete walkthrough of how I build my Monte Carlo algorithm, in order to predict the future Death Counts! 
* It will also include an Analysis of my model
*******
FILES

* The Covid-19-Analysis.rmd is the file that contains my Analysis and walkthrough behind building my predictive model!

* The monte-carlo-script.R is the script the full alogrithm that is used to create my Monte Carlo Simulation, with adjustable settings.

* The graphs folder will include all graphs that I have made for the Analysis, as well as for my predictive model!   

* raw folder will include the data files for my analysis, I will link the source at the bottom.

******* 
PLANS

* I plan on designing a graph that will pair my predictive models up with the actual data, as it gets released!

* When everything is said and done, I will do a short follow up Analysis on how well my predictive algorithm stood up to time!
