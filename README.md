# Covid-19-Analysis
IN PROGRESS

Welcome to my Covid-19 Analysis and prediction model!

My Covid-19 Analysis includes an in-depth look at Italys' Confirmed Deaths. It also includes a complete walkthrough of how I build my Monte Carlo algorithm, in order to predict the future Death Counts! 
* It also includes an Analysis of my model
*******
FILES

* the covid.html file is the output html page for the analysis! [It can be seen here...](https://alexander-kahanek.github.io/project/covid.html)

* The Covid-19-Analysis.rmd is the rmd file that everything was written and coded on!

* The monte-carlo-script.R is the full script that was used to create my Monte Carlo Simulation, with adjustable settings. 

* raw folder will include the data files for my analysis, I will link the source at the bottom.

* the future_data folder was data that I pulled to get the updated numbers to check my model accuracy.

* the predictions folder are csv files for the algorithm being ran with different hyperparameters

******* 
PLANS

* Once the COVID-19 pandemic is over, or has virtually stopped. I will come back and evalutate my algorithm to see how well it matches up to reality, over the course of the pandemic.
